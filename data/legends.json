        "description": "   Hastrman , also known as Aquarius , belonged to demonic beings with a human appearance. It had various forms in the superstition ideas of individual regions of Slovakia. In Liptov, water dripped from his hat and shirt, in Kysucie they imagined him again as an old man with green hair, with sad eyes and scales, in Orava he was a man overgrown with long shaggy hair that dried on the rocks. In relation to humans, the waterman manifested himself as an evil, harmful being - he dragged people under water and imprisoned their souls in mugs in his water dwelling. People protected themselves from it with garlic or plants, which were consecrated on May Sunday. Not far from Šurian stands the village of Kostolný Sek, which is inhabited by several monuments that remembered an ancient story. In the Church Section near the Nitra River, a hastrman, who was very evil, lived in the crown of a high willow tree - when bathing, he pulled the children by the legs and lured the pilgrims into the river, then dragged them underwater. At that time, many people who had never been found disappeared. The residents therefore decided to drown the hastrman at night, when they would only witness the moon. So they walked along the river towards the mill, waiting for the hastrman to see. When they saw him, they threw themselves on him, beat him, and drowned him. It was not until the morning that they discovered that the drowned man was their good miller, who went at night to check the mill drive and the water level in the river. Unfortunately, the inhabitants did not realize that the hastrman could not be drowned.",

        "name": "Elizabeth Bathory-The Blood Countess Countess Elizabeth Bthory de Ecsed",
        "description": "In 1602, rumors began to circulate around the village of Cachtice: peasant girls looking for servant work in the Csejte Castle were disappearing.A Hungarian noblewoman Bathory has been labeled by Guinness World Records as the most prolific female murderer,though the precise number of her victims is debated. BAthory and four collaborators were accused of torturing and killing hundreds of young girls and women between 1590 and 1610. The highest number of victims cited during Báthory's trial was 650. However, this number comes from the claim by a servant girl named Susannah that Jakab SzilvAssy, Bathoryss court official, had seen the figure in one of BAthoryS private books. The book was never revealed, and Szilvássy never mentioned it in his testimony.Despite the evidence against Bathory, her familyS importance kept her from facing execution. She was imprisoned in December 1610 within Castle of Csejte.The stories of BathoryS sadistic serial murders are verified by the testimony of more than 300 witnesses and survivors as well as physical evidence and the presence of horribly mutilated dead, dying and imprisoned girls found at the time of her arrest. Stories describing BAthoryss vampiric tendencies, such as the tale that she bathed in the blood of virgins to retain her youth, were generally recorded years after her death, and are considered unreliable. Her story quickly became part of national folklore, and her infamy persists to this day.Some insist she inspired Bram StokerS Dracula (1897),though there is no evidence to support this hypothesis. Nicknames and literary epithets attributed to her include The Blood Countess.",

He gave rise to many legends, myths, and is a constant mainstay of Slovak literature. Juraj Janosik was allegedly born in the 1680s in the settlement of Stefanova (now part of Terchova) in the Austrian monarchy. The period when Juraj was born was marked by anti-Habsburg uprisings led by the Hungarian nobility. Their goal was to gain the independence of Hungary through revolts.It was evil and turbulent times that brought hunger, disease, and endless suffering..In this storie, the main character was the mountain captain Jurko Janosik, who took from the rich and gave to the poor.He had gifts received from good fairies – a belt that made him invulnerable and a wallachian that protected him from superiority.He wandered through many places and hid in the gorge, which was later named Janosikove Diery.In the 19th century, rumors of a brave bandit came to literature. It was developed by passionate young poets, who named themselves Štúrovci.In their works, Jánošík became a symbol of the fight for freedom.This myth has persisted to this day, and the fact that Jánošík looted for less than three years does not change anything. He was caught, imprisoned and in 1713 publicly executed in Liptovsky Mikulas.We remember him and his legend will certainly be remembered by future generations as well..",

        "name": " Legend of Svorad and Benedict ",
        "description": "The oldest preserved legend and carved into the rock, which is the oldest pilgrimage site  telling about the life of saints is a legend by Bishop Maurus from the mid-11th century, where he describes how he knew both saints.After a few years, as a bishop, he learned from the abbot of Nitra, Filip, about the very strict asceticism of the hermit Svorad, about his death, about the miracles of his intercession, and about the assassination of Beňadik.Bishop Maurus dedicates most of the legend to St. Svorad. points to his peculiar martyrdom, extraordinary self-denial, and torment of the body, to the wonderful distortion of the heart.When this man retreated to hermit loneliness on Skalka, he often fasted to strengthen his spiritual life. At the time of the great 40-day fast, he was satisfied with only 40 nuts. These days as well as others, he also devoted himself to prayers, took an ax in his hands, and went to work in the woods. Suddenly, as he fainted while felling the wood in the mountain, a beautiful young man approached him, looking like an angel, took him to his cave. When the hermit recovered from his ecstasy, he confessed to his disciple Beňadik what he had experienced and swore an oath not to tell anyone about the incident until he died.After a days work, he gave the body such a rest that it could be called torment and suffering rather than rest. He halted the halluke oak logs with a fence and cut sharp reeds from all sides across the land. Sitting alone on the log as on a seat to refresh his body, he took a different position, that when his body, overwhelmed sleep, leaned to either side, the sharp reed-wound painfully felt. In addition, he placed a wooden crown on his head, on which he hung four stones from four sides, so that when the sleepy head tilted to either side, it would hit a stone.So when the last hour was approaching, he ordered those present to not take off his clothes from any of his clothes until Abbot Philip, whom he had sent. His father came when the venerable body was already dead, and undressing him to wash it, he found a metal chain that was already touching the entrails. Oh, a strange and unheard of thing! The chain, which turned the meat into rot from the inside, was covered with skin on the outside, but they would not have noticed this method of martyrdom if a knot of bound metal had not been seen above the navel. However, as the untied chain was pulled from the body, the sound of rattling ribs could be heard loudly. I gave half of the chain that I had asked and cared for from this abbot to the most Christian Duke, whose desire, when he longed for it from me, I could not deny. I also noticed what I had learned from Abbot Philips story after burying the blessed mans body, and it seemed worthy to know and remember. Benedict, after the death of Svorad, also intended to live in the same place. When, following the example of his teacher, he lived in sternness for three years, robbers came and, hoping that he had a lot of money, dragged him ashore, killed him, and threw him into the water. While searching for his body for a long time and not finding it, all year round they saw an eagle sitting on the bank of the river Váh, as if watching something. Alerting his body, they let one man plunge into the water, and found him as well-preserved as if he had died shortly before.",

        "description": "The romantic brick castle above Orava has its foundations in the 13th century, when it was a strategic point of the Amber Road. Under the maintenance of the Turzovci family, the castle has maintained an excellent condition. In 1922, the first black-and-white version of the film Dracula from 1922 was shot here, and the castle later became the setting for the films The King of the Thrush and the Falconer Tomáš. Orava Castle naturally attracts the views of not only foreign filmmakers. No wonder it became home to several film characters. One of them is the famous Vampire Nosferatu. Today, the cult black-and-white film was made here in 1922 by German director Friedrich Wilhelm Murnau. He chose Orava instead of the legendary Transylvania. He has no film with the unattractive Max Schreck in the lead role, laying one of the cornerstones of horror. It is an extraordinary work of German expressionism, a play of lights and shadows. A suggestive version of the story of a vampire inspired by the world work of Bram Stoker Dracula.",

She had the ability to cause long-term downpours, lightning, hail, infertility and was responsible for the spread of the plague. Magical plants, protective signs or objects (cross, garlic, poppy, willow, rosehip or hawthorn rods, sharp iron objects) were used to protect against the witch. If the witch was helpful, they called her a witch.Did you know that we have a village of witches in Slovakia? The village of Ružindol is located in the Trnava region and once witches lived there, which were even burned. As Slovak ethnologist Nádaská says, Matej Bel has already mentioned in her Notices that Ružindol was a village of witches, where many women practiced worship or enchantment - often women who were midwives, folk healers, understood nature and were able to use force. herbs. Historian Jozef Šimončič, who deals with the history of Trnava, in his book My Trnava again described the last trial with two Ružindol witches, who were burned in August 1684. They suspected them of witchcraft, both were tested with water, and because they swam, they were given to the executioner.",

A Virgin Margaret from a wealthy Carinthian family caught his eye. The girl's father politely refused Mikuláš's request, but the knight kidnapped Margaret. The Virgin Margaret did not defend herself too much, because they liked the young knight and after arriving in Devín also his beautiful castle.Before the wedding, Margaret's uncle Rafael, the abbot of Isenburg, visited Devín Castle. His gunmen seized the young girl, landed a horse, and galloped back to Carinthia. However, Knight Mikuláš caught up with them and regained his chosen one after the fight. After returning to the castle, preparations for the wedding began. As soon as the lovers said yes in the castle chapel, guns rattled again in the courtyard of the castle.Abbot Rafael deceived the guard with a ruse and broke into the castle. The Carinthians were in the lead and forced Knight Nicholas to retreat to a slender tower on a rocky promontory jutting above the confluence of the Danube and Moravia. In time, when the door of the tower was released under the onslaught of axes and fire, Knight Nicholas fell in an unequal battle. His young bride jumped into the Danube from grief. The mighty waters of the Virgin Margaret River were buried on her wedding day, and the tower on the rocky promontory has since been called the Virgin Tower.",

The young nobles complied with their father's request without much effort. Then the king had three rods tied, and again he called on the children to break the bundle. This task proved to be much more difficult. In this way, the king demonstrated to his descendants the need for unity, because only that helped them guarantee invincibility and prosperity for the country.",

        "description": "The rich Count Pálffy, who rebuilt the castle into a fairy-tale form, never married and had no children due to his unhappy love. However, he had a sister and other relatives, so before his death he wrote a will in which he wanted Bojnice Castle to remain accessible to all people. He wanted anyone to admire all the rare works of art - anyone, for example. When the count died, he was brought to Bojnice Castle and buried in a beautiful marble sarcophagus, which is still located here. His relatives were very greedy, they were attracted by his great wealth, and therefore they disobeyed his wish and sold many things. They sold paintings, furniture and sculptures. in 1933, another sad thing happened - thieves from a nearby village came to the castle and stole the 5 most beautiful and also the largest paintings from the altar from the count's chapel. They did so by remaining hidden in the chapel after visiting the castle, and in the evening they dismantled the paintings and carried them out the window. The thieves were captured, but the paintings and subsequently the whole altar that belonged to it got out of Slovakia for many years. It is said that all these events were so sad that they made the count cry even after his death. Apparently as early as the seventies, but at most in the late 90's, a mysterious liquid began to flow from the sarcophagus and no one knew where it came from. It didn't rain in the room, the cleaners didn't pour the heat out, so everyone was amazed. Eventually, the newspapers began to write that these were the tears of the sad Count Pálffy. He cried because his family disobeyed what he wanted in the will and cried also because his beautiful Florentine altar (painted by Narda di Cione in the 14th century) is no longer in the castle. The most interesting thing about the whole mystery is that these tears of his (liquid) stopped flowing at the time when they brought the altar back from Prague to the castle. The contented count could sleep his eternal dream again and no longer cry because his wish was fulfilled.Analysis of the sample showed that it was the remains of the count himself, together with the preservative they had used in his burial and the impurities from the time-damaged tin chest where he lay. All this flowed out through a small hole.",

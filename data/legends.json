        "description": "   Hastrman , also known as Aquarius , belonged to demonic beings with a human appearance. It had various forms in the superstition ideas of individual regions of Slovakia. In Liptov, water dripped from his hat and shirt, in Kysucie they imagined him again as an old man with green hair, with sad eyes and scales, in Orava he was a man overgrown with long shaggy hair that dried on the rocks. In relation to humans, the waterman manifested himself as an evil, harmful being - he dragged people under water and imprisoned their souls in mugs in his water dwelling. People protected themselves from it with garlic or plants, which were consecrated on May Sunday. Not far from Šurian stands the village of Kostolný Sek, which is inhabited by several monuments that remembered an ancient story. In the Church Section near the Nitra River, a hastrman, who was very evil, lived in the crown of a high willow tree - when bathing, he pulled the children by the legs and lured the pilgrims into the river, then dragged them underwater. At that time, many people who had never been found disappeared. The residents therefore decided to drown the hastrman at night, when they would only witness the moon. So they walked along the river towards the mill, waiting for the hastrman to see. When they saw him, they threw themselves on him, beat him, and drowned him. It was not until the morning that they discovered that the drowned man was their good miller, who went at night to check the mill drive and the water level in the river. Unfortunately, the inhabitants did not realize that the hastrman could not be drowned.",

        "description": "In 1602, rumors began to circulate around the village of Cachtice: peasant girls looking for servant work in the Csejte Castle were disappearing.A Hungarian noblewoman Bathory has been labeled by Guinness World Records as the most prolific female murderer,though the precise number of her victims is debated. BAthory and four collaborators were accused of torturing and killing hundreds of young girls and women between 1590 and 1610. The highest number of victims cited during Báthory's trial was 650. However, this number comes from the claim by a servant girl named Susannah that Jakab SzilvAssy, Bathoryss court official, had seen the figure in one of BAthoryS private books. The book was never revealed, and Szilvássy never mentioned it in his testimony.Despite the evidence against Bathory, her familyS importance kept her from facing execution. She was imprisoned in December 1610 within Castle of Csejte.The stories of BathoryS sadistic serial murders are verified by the testimony of more than 300 witnesses and survivors as well as physical evidence and the presence of horribly mutilated dead, dying and imprisoned girls found at the time of her arrest. Stories describing BAthoryss vampiric tendencies, such as the tale that she bathed in the blood of virgins to retain her youth, were generally recorded years after her death, and are considered unreliable. Her story quickly became part of national folklore, and her infamy persists to this day.Some insist she inspired Bram StokerS Dracula (1897),though there is no evidence to support this hypothesis. Nicknames and literary epithets attributed to her include The Blood Countess.",

        "name": "The Tribeč Mountains-The Slovak Bermuda Triangle",
        "description": "The Tribeč Mountains are full of many mysterious stories and disappearances. What is the truth about them?The Slovak Bermuda Triangle is accompanied by many legends. But where is the truth?We have a lot of mysterious and scary places, which are full of various legends, all over the world. And we can find a few of them in Slovakia as well. The Tribeč Mountains certainly belong to the most famous. It is located in the Fatra-Tatra region in the arc of the Inner Western Carpathians. The writer Jozef Karika took care of its mass popularization with all the horror novel Trhlina, which was later successfully filmed. There are several strange cases of mysterious disappearances associated with Tribeč. Information about them can be found in virtually every article about this mountain range. But are they true? Or are they just scary stories? We will take a closer look at this article.Lost forester = The vast Tribeč Mountains, lying between the towns of Nitra, Topoľčany, Partizánske and Zlaté Moravce, have the reputation of an ominous and potentially dangerous place. For some reason, people have been mysteriously disappearing there for more than 80 years. Let's recall at least some of the many notorious cases. The young woman disappeared without a trace = Another disappearance was to take place on January 18, 1930. Mária Švajzerová, 18, came from the village of Mankovce and on a fateful day she went to the village of Zlatno (about 4.5 kilometers away) to visit her grandparents and bring them some food. Before leaving, her mother allegedly told her not to stay anywhere along the way and quickly returned home.But Maria decided to shorten her way through the forest, but that was what happened to her. When she did not return, the parents went to Zlatno, but were surprised to find that no one had seen their daughter here. The next morning, with the help of neighbors, they started looking for the girl. The police were also informed about the whole matter. There was not a single trace of Maria Švajzerová. Missing couple = Another case is connected with husband and wife Ján and Alena Belanovičovce. In 1966, their abandoned car was found on the road from the village of Jelenec. But there was no trouble or hearing after the couple themselves. Based on the investigation, it was found that the Belanovics liked to go on trips, so they probably went to Tribeč out of love for nature. But they never returned from there.At the turn of 1979/1980, 76-year-old Antonín Topil allegedly disappeared again. He lived in the village of Skýcov and was allegedly a runaway loner and an eccentric who did not be very friendly with anyone. His disappearance came about by accident.The postwoman could not find him at home for several days in a row, so she was afraid if something had happened to him. Neighbors called the police and they found that Topil's house was empty. According to the police, Topil went to an unknown place, where an accident might have happened to him, or he decided that he would not return. The search yielded no results and he was eventually pronounced dead.Other cases =nevertheless, these legends about Tribeč already live their own lives and really prove how easily a complete fabrication can become a real-looking article, from which many other editors draw. However, if you are currently disappointed that the whole mythology around the Tribeč Mountains is created artificially, then do not despair completely. In addition to imaginary disappearances or deaths, we also have a few that have actually (and now really are) real in this area.One of them was 25-year-old Marek, who disappeared on August 13, 2017. The last time he was at a feast party in the village of Skýcov, where he stayed until the fourth morning. But then he disappeared. The police launched a search and finally found the young man by the stream in Skýcov.He did not communicate, was disoriented and had several injuries on his body. They had to operate on him in the hospital, but despite the doctors' efforts, they could no longer save him. Police were also investigating the possibility that someone unknown might have harmed him. In 2012, the 59-year-old mushroom maker Jaroslav Buránsky from the village of Žirany also disappeared near Tribeč.This has not yet been found. In 2019, 20-year-old Vladimír Švajlen disappeared around Tribeč. Apparently he just ran out to buy cigarettes, but then disappeared without a trace. Police managed to find him 3 kilometers from his house without signs of life.",

        "name": "Sintava witch-Worse than Báthoryčka?",
        "description": "Stanislav tried to find a suitable wife. On the advice of his uncle, the Hungarian palatine Juraj Thurz, he was introduced to Anna Rosina Listhiusová, who comes from an important Lower Austrian aristocratic family. Stanislav wanted to marry her right away. But his older brother Juraj, the Hungarian viceroy, did not like the fifteen-year-old countess at all.The wedding took place in 1598 and the newlyweds settled in Šintavský hrad near Sered. They gradually fathered three sons and a daughter. Her husband observed Anna's passion for torture, so he had her imprisoned for several years. She was allegedly imprisoned in Tematín, in the Prešpor Prison, but also in Čachtice, where she met Alžbeta Báthoryová in a dungeon. She allegedly warned her of the tragic consequences in times of repentance.However, over time, Thurzo forgave her everything, and so she was released. She was a woman who did not shy away from entertainment and society, and over time she began to spread rumors that she also had lovers. One of them was supposed to be Štefan Pálfi from Červený Kamen. As soon as her husband found out, the ground collapsed after her lover. Mysteriously, however, Stanislav himself died in 1625. Although it is said that he died during his treatment in the Piešťany spa, he was allegedly poisoned by his wife, who was well versed in herbal medicine.Anna Rosina was really a very special woman. She suffered from epilepsy, had visions, and probably suffered from a split in personality. Sometimes she manifested herself as a sensitive soul, loving her children, on the other hand, in bouts of sadistic passion, she committed crimes against servants and subjects. Unlike Báthoryčka, she did not bathe in the blood of virgins. It took her pleasure to torture and kill people regardless of gender or age. Palatine Nicholas Esterházy ordered an extensive investigation on June 29, 1637, 80 witnesses testified against the lord of the castle. Historian Tünde Lengyel states in the book Bosorky, strigy, Witches that 35-year-old Pavol Takács was one of the witnesses. He was said to have seen a naked maid through the crack in the door, with the help of two bachelors. The lady hit her in the head so hard that she broke her skull, from which her brain flowed. Among other things, she allegedly called herself local witches, with whom she closed herself in the room at midnight and enchanted. The heads of the puppies were to be boiled in a pot.And although she committed fewer victims than Báthoryčka, she was proven more violent and murdered. She was sentenced to forfeiture and the death penalty by beheading. Finally, Emperor Ferdinand III. he pardoned - her relatives had a great influence on the royal court. Anna Rosina then lived her life in seclusion at Šintavský Castle, where she died in oblivion in 1643,",

He gave rise to many legends, myths, and is a constant mainstay of Slovak literature. Juraj Janosik was allegedly born in the 1680s in the settlement of Stefanova (now part of Terchova) in the Austrian monarchy. The period when Juraj was born was marked by anti-Habsburg uprisings led by the Hungarian nobility. Their goal was to gain the independence of Hungary through revolts.It was evil and turbulent times that brought hunger, disease, and endless suffering..In this storie, the main character was the mountain captain Jurko Janosik, who took from the rich and gave to the poor.He had gifts received from good fairies – a belt that made him invulnerable and a wallachian that protected him from superiority.He wandered through many places and hid in the gorge, which was later named Janosikove Diery.In the 19th century, rumors of a brave bandit came to literature. It was developed by passionate young poets, who named themselves Štúrovci.In their works, Jánošík became a symbol of the fight for freedom.This myth has persisted to this day, and the fact that Jánošík looted for less than three years does not change anything. He was caught, imprisoned and in 1713 publicly executed in Liptovsky Mikulas.We remember him and his legend will certainly be remembered by future generations as well..",

        "name": " Legend of Svorad and Benedict ",
        "description": "The oldest preserved legend and carved into the rock, which is the oldest pilgrimage site  telling about the life of saints is a legend by Bishop Maurus from the mid-11th century, where he describes how he knew both saints.After a few years, as a bishop, he learned from the abbot of Nitra, Filip, about the very strict asceticism of the hermit Svorad, about his death, about the miracles of his intercession, and about the assassination of Beňadik.Bishop Maurus dedicates most of the legend to St. Svorad. points to his peculiar martyrdom, extraordinary self-denial, and torment of the body, to the wonderful distortion of the heart.When this man retreated to hermit loneliness on Skalka, he often fasted to strengthen his spiritual life. At the time of the great 40-day fast, he was satisfied with only 40 nuts. These days as well as others, he also devoted himself to prayers, took an ax in his hands, and went to work in the woods. Suddenly, as he fainted while felling the wood in the mountain, a beautiful young man approached him, looking like an angel, took him to his cave. When the hermit recovered from his ecstasy, he confessed to his disciple Beňadik what he had experienced and swore an oath not to tell anyone about the incident until he died.After a days work, he gave the body such a rest that it could be called torment and suffering rather than rest. He halted the halluke oak logs with a fence and cut sharp reeds from all sides across the land. Sitting alone on the log as on a seat to refresh his body, he took a different position, that when his body, overwhelmed sleep, leaned to either side, the sharp reed-wound painfully felt. In addition, he placed a wooden crown on his head, on which he hung four stones from four sides, so that when the sleepy head tilted to either side, it would hit a stone.So when the last hour was approaching, he ordered those present to not take off his clothes from any of his clothes until Abbot Philip, whom he had sent. His father came when the venerable body was already dead, and undressing him to wash it, he found a metal chain that was already touching the entrails. Oh, a strange and unheard of thing! The chain, which turned the meat into rot from the inside, was covered with skin on the outside, but they would not have noticed this method of martyrdom if a knot of bound metal had not been seen above the navel. However, as the untied chain was pulled from the body, the sound of rattling ribs could be heard loudly. I gave half of the chain that I had asked and cared for from this abbot to the most Christian Duke, whose desire, when he longed for it from me, I could not deny. I also noticed what I had learned from Abbot Philips story after burying the blessed mans body, and it seemed worthy to know and remember. Benedict, after the death of Svorad, also intended to live in the same place. When, following the example of his teacher, he lived in sternness for three years, robbers came and, hoping that he had a lot of money, dragged him ashore, killed him, and threw him into the water. While searching for his body for a long time and not finding it, all year round they saw an eagle sitting on the bank of the river Váh, as if watching something. Alerting his body, they let one man plunge into the water, and found him as well-preserved as if he had died shortly before.",

Under the maintenance of the Turzovci family, the castle has maintained an excellent condition. In 1922, the first black-and-white version of the film Dracula from 1922 was shot here, and the castle later became the setting for the films The King of the Thrush and the Falconer Tomáš. Orava Castle naturally attracts the views of not only foreign filmmakers. No wonder it became home to several film characters. One of them is the famous Vampire Nosferatu. Today, the cult black-and-white film was made here in 1922 by German director Friedrich Wilhelm Murnau. He chose Orava instead of the legendary Transylvania. He has no film with the unattractive Max Schreck in the lead role, laying one of the cornerstones of horror. It is an extraordinary work of German expressionism, a play of lights and shadows. A suggestive version of the story of a vampire inspired by the world work of Bram Stoker Dracula.",

Magical plants, protective signs or objects (cross, garlic, poppy, willow, rosehip or hawthorn rods, sharp iron objects) were used to protect against the witch. If the witch was helpful, they called her a witch.Did you know that we have a village of witches in Slovakia? The village of Ružindol is located in the Trnava region and once witches lived there, which were even burned. As Slovak ethnologist Nádaská says, Matej Bel has already mentioned in her Notices that Ružindol was a village of witches, where many women practiced worship or enchantment - often women who were midwives, folk healers, understood nature and were able to use force. herbs. Historian Jozef Šimončič, who deals with the history of Trnava, in his book My Trnava again described the last trial with two Ružindol witches, who were burned in August 1684.

The Virgin Margaret did not defend herself too much, because they liked the young knight and after arriving in Devín also his beautiful castle.Before the wedding, Margaret's uncle Rafael, the abbot of Isenburg, visited Devín Castle. His gunmen seized the young girl, landed a horse, and galloped back to Carinthia. However, Knight Mikuláš caught up with them and regained his chosen one after the fight. After returning to the castle, preparations for the wedding began. As soon as the lovers said yes in the castle chapel, guns rattled again in the courtyard of the castle.Abbot Rafael deceived the guard with a ruse and broke into the castle. The Carinthians were in the lead and forced Knight Nicholas to retreat to a slender tower on a rocky promontory jutting above the confluence of the Danube and Moravia. In time, when the door of the tower was released under the onslaught of axes and fire, Knight Nicholas fell in an unequal battle. His young bride jumped into the Danube from grief.

        "name": "Sarcophagus of Count Pálffy, who had been crying until recently",
        "description": "The rich Count Pálffy, who rebuilt the castle into a fairy-tale form, never married and had no children due to his unhappy love. However, he had a sister and other relatives, so before his death he wrote a will in which he wanted Bojnice Castle to remain accessible to all people. He wanted anyone to admire all the rare works of art - anyone, for example. When the count died, he was brought to Bojnice Castle and buried in a beautiful marble sarcophagus, which is still located here. His relatives were very greedy, they were attracted by his great wealth, and therefore they disobeyed his wish and sold many things. They sold paintings, furniture and sculptures. in 1933, another sad thing happened - thieves from a nearby village came to the castle and stole the 5 most beautiful and also the largest paintings from the altar from the count's chapel. They did so by remaining hidden in the chapel after visiting the castle, and in the evening they dismantled the paintings and carried them out the window. The thieves were captured, but the paintings and subsequently the whole altar that belonged to it got out of Slovakia for many years. It is said that all these events were so sad that they made the count cry even after his death. Apparently as early as the seventies, but at most in the late 90's, a mysterious liquid began to flow from the sarcophagus and no one knew where it came from. It didn't rain in the room, the cleaners didn't pour the heat out, so everyone was amazed. Eventually, the newspapers began to write that these were the tears of the sad Count Pálffy. He cried because his family disobeyed what he wanted in the will and cried also because his beautiful Florentine altar (painted by Narda di Cione in the 14th century) is no longer in the castle. The most interesting thing about the whole mystery is that these tears of his (liquid) stopped flowing at the time when they brought the altar back from Prague to the castle. The contented count could sleep his eternal dream again and no longer cry because his wish was fulfilled.Analysis of the sample showed that it was the remains of the count himself, together with the preservative they had used in his burial and the impurities from the time-damaged tin chest where he lay. All this flowed out through a small hole. Another legend speaks about the Black Lady says that a certain gentleman once lived there with his wife. The lord had to go to war, and when he returned after the war, he heard that his wife was having fun with foreign knights. The Lord believed these malicious words and decided that his wife must submit to God's judgment. It meant that she had to jump out of the window of Huňady's tower into the abyss below. If nothing happens to her and she survives, it will be a sign that she is innocent. His young wife, dressed in a black dress, aware of innocence, jumped out of the tower window with the baby in her arms. But few expected what had happened. The lady of the castle did not collapse into the abyss, instead she rose to the heights and disappeared into the clouds. However, all those who slandered the castle lady found themselves in the abyss, especially many of her envious relatives. With broken heads and tongues out. The lord of the castle humbly went to the monastery, from where he never left again. Since then, however, there are often lamentations and sobs around the castle. Apparently they are the lost souls of the relatives of the castle lady. And allegedly, the castle lady herself, dressed in black, has appeared at the chateau ever since. He wanders around the castle and mourns for his husband, who believed the evil words of the enemies and not her. However, only those who are sinless and believers will reportedly see it.",

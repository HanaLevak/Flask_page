            <span class="section-heading"> Walk through our medieval castles is a real experience!</span>

            <p>Slovakia is replete with gothic churches, medieval towns, macabre torture inventions, as well as majestic mountains and looming castles
                along bucolic rural landscapes. Fittingly, legend after legend arose in such surroundings, many of which were based on enigmatic
                historical figures. All that beauty serve as open invitations to the stretches of imagination. But then again, the best legends rely
                on a least some smidgeon of truth. And so, during the rare moments when the villagers met during the winters for yarning and there, in
                addition to magical fictional fairy tales, they told stories. These stories have been enriched with elements of reality. Real people
                appear in them and the places where the stories take place are also real..</p>

                    Castles, chateaux and manors in Slovakia form an important part of immovable cultural
                    monuments. Today, many of these buildings serve the development of culture such as museums, galleries and are
                    made available for tourism. In addition to cultural, educational and aesthetic functions
                    they also represent significant material values. Therefore, it is necessary to protect ,record and document those historical
                    objects.

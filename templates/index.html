    <strong> Walk through our medieval castles is a real experience!</strong>
 Their high stone walls standing on high cliffs look impregnable and we have goosebumps when we imagine that we are standing in places where kings were walking, queens where fights or coronations took place. These were the times when people believed in magic, witchcraft and many supernatural beings. We are left with magical legends, anchored for hundreds of years.

            <h3>Orava Castle </h3>
			<p>
		Orava Castle - as fairy as it is scary
And it really is. Orava Castle naturally attracts the views of not only foreign filmmakers. No wonder it became home to several film characters. One of them is the famous Vampire Nosferatu. Today, the cult black-and-white film was made here in 1922 by German director Friedrich Wilhelm Murnau. He chose Orava instead of the legendary Transylvania. He has no film with the unattractive Max Schreck in the lead role, laying one of the cornerstones of horror. It is "an extraordinary work of German expressionism, a play of lights and shadows. A suggestive version of the story of a vampire inspired by the world work of Bram Stoker Dracula. "

               <h3>Superstitious creatures</h3>
            <p>
            The notions of superstition beings in the spiritual world of our ancestors were diverse. Belief in these beings was perceived as a fact confirmed by the experience of individuals with these beings. Beings were often of human origin; they entered the supernatural world after premature or violent death. After their death, many of them did not find peace, so they visited the homes of our ancestors or appeared in other places under certain circumstances, which may be related to holidays, traditions and customs. Posthumous peace was often not found by women who died before the wedding, during childbirth, or those who drowned.

     <p>
			Ideas in the people's social environment to be ideas that reflect people's faith in the existence of supernatural forces and beings and in their influence on man. Folk faith regarded contact with a supernatural being or phenomenon as an authentic and real experience, and so oral stories or narratives in which our ancestors described experiences with supernatural beings, phenomena, or phenomena spread by word of mouth. Encounters with these beings took place under certain magical circumstances, in mysterious, unusual places or in the forest.

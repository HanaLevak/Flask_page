            <h3>Orava Castle </h3>
			<p>
				Orava Castle - as fairy as it is scary
And it really is. Orava Castle naturally attracts the views of not only foreign filmmakers. No wonder it became home to several film characters. One of them is the famous Vampire Nosferatu. Today, the cult black-and-white film was made here in 1922 by German director Friedrich Wilhelm Murnau. He chose Orava instead of the legendary Transylvania. He has no film with the unattractive Max Schreck in the lead role, laying one of the cornerstones of horror. It is "an extraordinary work of German expressionism, a play of lights and shadows. A suggestive version of the story of a vampire inspired by the world work of Bram Stoker Dracula. "

            <h3>The White Lady of Levoča</h3>
			<p>
Slovakia has three White Ladies; one from Bratislava, one from Bojnice Castle, and another from Levoca. The one from Levoca is based on Julia Korponayova, who, when spying for the Hapsburg emperor in Levoca, a town which was presently besieged by the Hapsburg army outside its walls, became the lover of the rebel Hungarian baron. During the night, she stole his keys, and let the army in, leading to the fall of the town. This didn’t stop her from meeting an unfortunate end, however.

			Modern Slovakia was born as an independent nation-state in 1993, when it peacefully separated from the Czech Republic, splitting from the former Czechoslovakia by mutual agreement. (There has been no organized conflict of any kind in Slovakia since 1945.) Many foreigners still confuse Slovakia with Slovenia of the former Yugoslavia. 
                No discussion of Slovak culture can take place without a nod to the country’s folkloric traditions. From music and dance ensembles, to handicrafts, open-air markets and festivals, we explore how folk traditions are alive and well in modern-day Slovakia, and continue to receive widespread support. .

            <h3>Superstitious creatures</h3>
            <p>
The notions of superstition beings in the spiritual world of our ancestors were diverse. Belief in these beings was perceived as a fact confirmed by the experience of individuals with these beings. Beings were often of human origin; they entered the supernatural world after premature or violent death. After their deaths, many of them did not find peace, so they visited the homes of our ancestors or appeared in other places under certain circumstances, which may have been related to holidays, traditions and customs. 
Posthumous peace was often not found by women who died before the wedding, during childbirth, or those who drowned.</p>
